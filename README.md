BigHWAriel.py 

Created and implemented a Cuckoo Hash data structure that  recursively limits collisions.
It continuously evicts keys from one hash table and inputs them into its second hash table  until:

1. A spot was found in either hash table
2. The hash tables needed to grow in size
3. The Bit Hash hashing function was reset. 

finalProjectCompScieNew.py

An educational and interactive game that utilizes draw.py to animate a spinner and create a question and answer-option page.
Utilized two-dimensional lists to organize the questions, category, answer choice, and correct answer. 

BloomFilterHW.py

Created and implement a Bloom Filter, useful in optimizing the amount of storage needed depending on an intended 
max-false-positive rate and number of intended keys to be inserted.
